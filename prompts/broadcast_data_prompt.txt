Follow your instructions to generate a broadcast update for the current play using the data below:

user_preferences:
- Description: This includes priority players that the user is interested, the desired tone/storyline for their broadcast (i.e., how they wish to "view" the game), and extracted information from any images they've uploaded (e.g., bet slips, fantasy roster, etc.).
- Data: {preferences}

game_information:
- Description: This includes the latest details of the game such as score, time remaining, possession, weather, etc.
- Data: {game_info}

play_information:
- Description: This includes data on what happened during the current play (e.g., players involved, play description, yards gained, etc.). Note, the "Team" field represents which team had possession of the ball at the start of the given play. 
- Data: {play_info}

player_box_scores:
- Description: This includes the current box scores (i.e., game stats) for the players involved in the play. The box_scores data also includes players' fantasy stats.
- Data: {player_box_scores}
    
player_season_stats:
- Description: This includes the season stats for the players involved in the play (i.e., their stats for the season thus far up until, but not including, this game). 
               Note, for the season type codes, SeasonType 1 = preseason, SeasonType 2 = regular season, SeasonType 3 = post season. Please use this information when referencing data from player_season_stats (e.g., if the SeasonType = 3, say "this postseason" instead of "this season").
               It's important to know that the player_season_stats are NOT INCLUSINVE of the current games stats (i.e., player_box_scores). For example if a player has 9 touch downs in player_season_stats and 1 touchdown in player_box_scores you should interpret this as "one touchdown today making it his 10th of the season".
